# Orchestrated Backend Infrastructure – Food Ordering System

This repository demonstrates a **distributed backend architecture** built with **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and orchestrated via **Kubernetes**. It focuses on solving common backend challenges: service decoupling, stateful data persistence, and secure role-based access.

### 🌟 Project Core Values

* **Production-Oriented Deployment:** Instead of a simple local setup, this project uses **Kubernetes (Minikube)** to implement production patterns like **Init Containers** (for automated migrations) and **StatefulSets** (for database reliability).
* **Granular Access Control:** Implements a complete **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system and **JWT Authentication**, ensuring secure interactions between Admin, Manager, Delivery Crew, and Customers.
* **High-Fidelity Environment:** Utilizes a multi-container setup with **Nginx**, **Gunicorn**, and **MySQL**, mimicking the complexity of a real-world distributed system.

---

## 🚀 System Evolution & Architectural Trade-offs

This project was developed through an iterative process, simulating a real-world transition from a local prototype to a **high-fidelity orchestrated system**.

---

### Stage 1: Local Monolithic Deployment

**Initial State**
* **Architecture:** Django application and SQLite database running as a single, tightly coupled unit on a local machine.
* **Trade-offs:** Fast to develop and simple to test, but lacked **High Availability (HA)**. 
* **The Problem:** Any database migration or code change created a **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**—if the application crashed, the entire service (and its access to data) vanished.

> **Key Insight:** Tightly coupled application and database lifecycles make failure recovery unpredictable and scaling nearly impossible.

---

### Stage 2: Containerization with Docker

**Improvements**
* **Standardization:** Packaged Django, Nginx, and the environment into containers using **Docker Compose**.
* **Fidelity:** Solved the "it works on my machine" problem by ensuring consistent runtime environments across different development setups.

**Remaining Issues**
* **Logical Monolith:** While containerized, the system was still managed as a single logical unit. 
* **Coupling:** Database initialization and application startup remained dependent on one another without a formal orchestration layer.

---

### Stage 3: Kubernetes-Orchestrated Architecture (Current)

This stage achieves a **High-Fidelity Environment** by decoupling the application into independent, orchestrated components.


**1. Separation of Deployment Responsibilities**
* Decoupled the monolithic logic into distinct layers (Nginx, Django, MySQL), managed as independent Kubernetes workloads.
* Each component now has its own **Lifecycle and Restart Policy**, improving system resilience.

**2. Deterministic Startup with Init Containers**
* **Problem:** Distributed systems often face "race conditions" where the app starts before the database is ready.
* **Solution:** Implemented **Init Containers** to handle database migrations and connectivity checks.
* **Value:** Ensures the main Django container only starts when the infrastructure is ready, making deployments predictable.

**3. Database Strategy: Migration from SQLite to MySQL**
* **Technical Challenge:** Identified that SQLite’s file-based storage is incompatible with the **ephemeral nature** of Kubernetes Pods. In a containerized environment, local file changes are lost upon Pod termination or rescheduling.
* **Architectural Decision:** Migrated the persistence layer to **MySQL** utilizing **StatefulSets** and **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)** to decouple data storage from the compute lifecycle.
* **Impact:** Achieved guaranteed **Data Durability** and system resilience. The application layer became truly **Stateless**, satisfying a core requirement for scalable distributed systems.

**4. Networking & Infrastructure Orchestration**
To ensure system reliability and security, I implemented a multi-layer networking strategy that decouples the application from the underlying infrastructure.

#### 🌐 Traffic Routing Logic:
* **Gateway Layer (Nginx):** Acts as the single entry point, listening on port `80`. It performs reverse proxying to the application layer and handles static asset offloading to reduce backend load.
* **Application Layer (Django):** Operates on port `8000`. It is entirely **environment-agnostic**, retrieving its database location via the `DB_HOST` environment variable injected by Kubernetes.
* **Database Layer (MySQL):** Isolated within the internal network on port `3306`, accessible only through the stable DNS handle `mysql-service`.

#### 🧬 Service Discovery & Dependency Management:
* **Stable Identifiers:** By utilizing **Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP)**, components communicate via stable DNS names (e.g., `mysql-service`) rather than volatile Pod IPs. This ensures zero-downtime internal routing during Pod rescheduling.
* **Deterministic Startup (Init Containers):** * Implemented a `wait-for-db` logic using **Init Containers** to check port 3306 availability via `netcat`.
    * This prevents "Race Conditions" where the Django app might crash if it attempts to connect before the MySQL service is fully operational.
    * Database migrations (`python manage.py migrate`) are executed within this stage to ensure schema readiness before the main application boots.

#### 🔐 Secure External Mapping:
* **Local Development:** Bridged the isolated K8s network to the host using `kubectl port-forward` on port `8080`.
* **Host Validation:** Leveraged Django's `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to perform strict **Host Header Validation**, ensuring the application only processes requests routed through the verified Nginx gateway.

## 🛠️ Backend Implementation & Business Logic

While the infrastructure ensures stability, the backend is engineered for secure, scalable food ordering operations:

### 1. Robust Access Control (RBAC)
* **JWT Authentication:** Secure stateless session management via `rest_framework_simplejwt`.
* **Granular Permissions:** Implemented custom permission classes to enforce role-based logic:
    * **Admin/Manager:** Full CRUD over Menu & Categories; Order assignment.
    * **Delivery Crew:** Read-only access to assigned orders; Status update capability (`mark_delivered`).
    * **Customer:** Personalized Cart management and Order history.

### 2. Functional Order & Cart Pipeline
* **Dynamic Cart System:** Each user session is isolated, supporting atomic operations for adding/updating/clearing items.
* **Efficient Querying:** Menu items feature advanced filtering (`?category=`) and ordering (`?sort=price`) implemented via DRF `FilterBackend`.
* **Order Lifecycle:** Optimized endpoint (`/create_from_cart/`) to convert cart items into orders with relational integrity, ensuring price snapshots at the time of purchase.
